# 💡 Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
The platform and its models are still under development.

Several key improvements are planned in the coming months — for example, refining the data pipeline to distinguish organic from inorganic assessments, integrating additional databases, add new features, etc.

A first version of the platform was released in November 2025 to start identifying contributors, early users, and potential funding partners.

## What is OpenChemFacts?

OpenChemFacts is an open-data platform dedicated to the assessment of chemicals’ ecotoxicity.\
It provides transparent, reproducible and scientifically robust indicators derived from internationally recognized models.

The platform focuses on two core pillars:

1. Data collection and harmonization from major regulatory and scientific sources\
   (e.g. US EPA ECOTOX, EU REACH, OECD dossiers, national inventories).
2. Ecotoxicity characterization using internationally recognized models\
   (e.g. USEtox, EF 3.1, and other consensus methods developed under UNEP/SETAC initiatives).

## Why OpenChemFacts ?

Chemicals are essential for modern societies, yet their global production is expected to double by 2030.&#x20;

A large share of these substances presents hazardous properties that may affect ecosystems and human health.

Despite this, a critical information gap persists, largely due to:

* Data scarcity: ecotoxicological data remains fragmented, heterogeneous or inaccessible.
* Methodological gaps: many chemicals lack harmonized characterization factors enabling comparative assessment.

To bridge these gaps, consensus scientific models are indispensable for quantifying potential ecotoxicological impacts across the life cycle of chemicals, products and technologies.

OpenChemFacts integrates these models and consolidates experimental data to produce transparent and robust ecotoxicity characterization factors for chemicals widely used in industry, research, and policy assessment.
