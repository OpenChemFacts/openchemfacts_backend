# 📊 Methodology

OpenChemFacts provides aquatic ecotoxicity impacts for thousands of chemicals.

These impacts are calculated in alignment with the requirements of the latest developments in the USEtox model (cf. this [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522033008?via%3Dihub)  for more information).

{% hint style="info" %}
OpenChemFacts platform is under construction and only provides hazard values (effect factor) as of now.

Once Fate Factors (FF) and Exposure Factors (XP) are introduced it will be possible to calculate risk values (characterization factors). &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
OpenChemFacts calculated results are not formal USEtox factors.&#x20;

The platform displays :&#x20;

* formal USEtox and EF3.1 factors,
* calculated OpenChemFacts factors.
